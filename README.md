# KADBOXES

That's Kaj's CAD Boxes. A collection of boxes and shapes for 3D printing.

Using the awesome [CadQuery][cadquery], this repo provides a docker-compose file 
that can be used to quick get up and running constructing your own print files.

## Usage

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start a jupyter notebook server on port 8888. You can then open any of the notebooks and start playing around with the code.
